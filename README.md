# Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV)



The Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV) is designed to support the exchange of information between organisations defining criteria and organisations responding to these criteria by means of evidences.

The CCCEV contains two basic and complementary core concepts:

* the requirement, something used as the basis for making a judgement or decision, e.g. a requirement set in a public tender or a condition that has to be fulfilled for a public service to be executed; and
* the evidence, something which proves that something else exists or is true, in particular an evidence is used to prove that a specific criterion is met by someone of by something.
